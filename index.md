 ## About Me

  <div>
    I'm a resilient and intuitive data analyst based in France, with a strong sense of adaptability and a cross-cultural perspective shaped by my dual background.  
    I love exploring how data can clarify complex problems and support smarter decision-making. Curious by nature, I enjoy digging beneath the surface and connecting dots others might miss.  

    Outside of work and studies, I’m usually in the kitchen baking something new, deep in a book, or exploring topics around health and behavior.
