Hey! I’m a 24-year-old aspiring data analyst, currently finishing my MSc in Data Science & Organizational Behavior. I’m looking for a 6-month final internship starting between July and August 2025, based in France. My dual cultural background has shaped how I see the world and approach my work.

I’m naturally curious and love finding patterns in messy data especially when it helps explain human behavior or supports smarter decision-making. I’m particularly drawn to the human side of data: what drives people, how systems interact, and how numbers can tell real stories. Whether I’m prototyping dashboards, running machine learning models, or designing behavioral experiments, I aim to combine analytical rigor with context and empathy.

In my free time, you’ll likely find me in the kitchen cooking or baking to relax and recharge, lost in a book, or diving into new cultures and topics.
