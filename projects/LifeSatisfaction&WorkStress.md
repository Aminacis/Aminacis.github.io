title: Life Satisfaction, Working Hours & Unemployment
permalink: /projects/LifeSatisfaction&WorkStress
---

## Overview
This project explores how working hours and unemployment rates influence life satisfaction across countries over time, using regression and statistical modeling in Python.

## Objective
To assess whether increased work demands and job insecurity negatively affect well-being and how these dynamics interact.

## Tools & Skills
Python (pandas, seaborn, statsmodels)
Data wrangling
Regression analysis
Policy implications

## Methods
Cleaned and merged datasets on working hours, life satisfaction, and unemployment.
Calculated year-over-year changes for key variables.
Built a regression model to test hypotheses and interaction effects.
Visualized trends and correlations using seaborn/matplotlib.

## Outcomes
Working hours negatively impact life satisfaction.
Unemployment also affects satisfaction but more weakly.
Significant interaction found: in high-unemployment settings, working hours might offer a sense of security, reducing dissatisfaction.
RÂ² = 0.083, model is statistically significant (p < 0.001).
