## Overview
This R-based project analyzes the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), demographics, and public health outcomes across Chicago neighborhoods.

---

## Objective
To uncover how socioeconomic inequality is linked to key health indicators and identify vulnerable communities for targeted intervention.

---
## Tools & Skills
R (dplyr, ggplot2, tmap, sf)
Spatial analysis
SES index creation
Regression modeling

---
## Methods
Cleaned and merged health and census data at the community level.
Created an SES index using variables like income, education, and unemployment.
Conducted spatial visualization using interactive maps (tmap).
Built multiple regression models to assess links between SES and health outcomes (e.g., diabetes, obesity).

---
## Outcomes
Strong negative correlation between SES and chronic disease prevalence.
Interactive maps revealed clusters of poor health in low-SES areas like West Garfield Park and Englewood.
Regression showed SES as a strong predictor for several health outcomes.
Provided data-driven insight for targeted public health efforts in at-risk communities.
