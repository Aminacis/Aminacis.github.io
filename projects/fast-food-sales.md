## Overview  
This project analyzes a local restaurant's transaction data to understand customer purchasing patterns, optimize menu offerings, and improve overall profitability. Tableau is used for interactive data visualization and dashboard design.

---
## Objective  
To enhance the restaurant's performance by addressing key business questions:

How have total sales evolved month-over-month or year-over-year?
Which food items are most frequently purchased together?
What are the top-selling items within specific customer segments?
How does revenue vary across different payment methods (cash vs online)?
Is there a correlation between average transaction value and payment type?
Do male and female customers contribute differently to sales?
How do sales trends vary throughout the day and year?
Which food items are most popular overall?

## Methods  
Built interactive Tableau dashboards for dynamic exploration.
Analyzed sales evolution over time using line graphs and bar charts.
Used item combination filters to identify frequently paired products.
Created segmented visualizations by gender, item type, and payment method.
Explored correlations between transaction value and payment type.
Compared hourly and monthly trends in item popularity.
Ranked top-performing food items by volume and revenue.

---
## Outcomes  
A noticeable drop in total sales between 2022 and 2024, with fewer items per transaction.
Sandwiches are 23.56% more expensive than other items but not in the top 5 best-sellingâ€”highlighting a mismatch between pricing and demand.
Cash is still the preferred payment method, with revenue implications.
Beverages are frequently bought but underperforming in terms of revenue, signaling a pricing or promotional opportunity.
Men and women show similar preferences for fast food over drinks, with minor differences in purchasing behavior.

---
## Audience Insights  
The restaurant caters to a wide base of customers who slightly prefer fast food over beverages. Despite beverages being top-sellers, their pricing strategy may hinder overall sales. Inventory and marketing strategies can be tailored by analyzing time-of-day and seasonal sales patterns.

---
## Dataset Description  
The dataset includes:
Order IDs and timestamps  
Item names and categories (Fast-food, Beverages)  
Item prices and quantities  
Transaction amounts and payment types (cash, online, null, etc.)  
Gender of the staff processing the order  
Sale times (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night, Midnight)


---
### Foreseeable Challenges  
Limited customer demographic info (no age, loyalty status, etc.)  
Lack of transaction-level KPIs  
Missing context around payment platform details (fees, delays)  
Interpreting demand without deeper consumer preference data
